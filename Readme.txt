    This file is part of the Scharre Soft™ Tlc5940_AVR0 Library. This library was 
    developed to work with microcontrollers from the megaAVR® 0-series, in 
    particular the Arduino Nano Every (ATmega4809).

    Most of the code in this library comes from the e-book "Demystifying the 
    TLC5940" that was written by Matthew T. Pandina. I modified the code for the 
    port registers, the timers, the SPI and the ISR, so that it would work with 
    microcontrollers from the megaAVR® 0-series. In addition, I added a parameter 
    (GRAYSCALE_RESOLUTION) that allows one to adjust the PWM frequency, I renamed 
    some functions and parameters so that they resemble those from the Alex Leone 
    library, and I added a small configuration file (Tlc_AVR0_config.h). Most of 
    the modified code can be found in the Tlc_init() function in Tlc5940_AVR0.cpp. 

    The Arduino TLC5940_AVR0 Library is distributed WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. In no 
    event shall Scharre Soft™ be liable for any direct or indirect damages 
    arising out of the use of this software. Use at your own risk. The original

   ARDUINO 
   Nano Every                                      TLC5940
   ATmega4809 




NB1: The number of TLC5940's (NUM_TLCS) can be changed by editing the 
Tlc_AVR0_config.h file: set NUM_TLCS to the desired number of TLC5940's. 


NB2: If you want to use the manual Dot Correction functions, edit the Tlc_AVR0_config.h 
file: set USE_DC_FUNCTIONS to 1, connect pin D4 of the Arduino to pin 19 of the TLC5940, 
and connect pin D7 of the Arduino to pin 27 of the TLC5940. Enabling the Dot Correction 
functions will require 126 bytes of Flash memory and you will need Arduino pins D4 and D7. 
If you are not going to use Dot Correction, USE_DC_FUNCTIONS should be set to 0, so that 
pin D4 and D7 are available as a GPIO. 


NB3: This library gives you 12 bit greyscale resolution (0 - 4095) at a PWM frequency of 
1,96 KHz. If needed, the PWM frequency can be increased, but the resolution will decrease 
accordingly. Edit the value of GRAYSCALE_RESOLUTION in Tlc_AVR0_config.h

   GRAYSCALE_RESOLUTION	8191	12 bit resolution (0-4095)	1,96 kHz PWM
   GRAYSCALE_RESOLUTION 4095	11 bit resolution (0-2047)	3,92 kHz PWM
   GRAYSCALE_RESOLUTION 2047	10 bit resolution (0-1023)	7,85 kHz PWM
   GRAYSCALE_RESOLUTION 1023	9 bit resolution  (0-511)	15,7 kHz PWM
   GRAYSCALE_RESOLUTION 511	8  bit resolution (0-255)	31,4 kHz PWM
   GRAYSCALE_RESOLUTION 255	7  bit resolution (0-127)	62,8 kHz PWM
   GRAYSCALE_RESOLUTION 127	6  bit resolution (0-63)	125 kHz  PWM


NB4: pin D12 becomes unusable when using this library because of the PORTMUX command that 
is needed to change the hardware SPI pins from the default location. Pin D12 is reserved 
as the MISO pin for the SPI, and can not be used as a GPIO. This problem could be overcome 
by using Bit Banging / softSPI in stead of the hardware SPI, but this is not supported by 
this library.
