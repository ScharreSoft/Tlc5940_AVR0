# Tlc5940_AVR0
A Tlc5940 library for the Arduino Nano Every (Atmega4809)
I was looking for a TLC5940 library that would work on the Arduino Nano Every, but I could not find one. Using the e-book "Demystifying the TLC5940" that was written by Matthew T. Pandina, I was able to make my own library. I did not try it but I think it could be adapted to work on other microcontrollers from the megaAVRÂ® 0-series. I tested the library with a maximum of two daisy chained TLC5940's and it worked fine.


Features:
- Dot Correction
- PWM frequency can be increased (grayscale resolution will decrease accordingly)
- Pin compatible with the Arduino Nano v3

Drawback:
- Arduino pin D12 becomes unusable as a GPIO
