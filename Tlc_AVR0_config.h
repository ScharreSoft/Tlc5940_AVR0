    /******************************** Scharre Soft™ *******************************

    This file is part of the Scharre Soft™ Tlc5940_AVR0 Library. This library was 
    developed to work with microcontrollers from the megaAVR® 0-series, in 
    particular the Arduino Nano Every (ATmega4809).

    Most of the code in this library comes from the e-book "Demystifying the 
    TLC5940" that was written by Matthew T. Pandina. I modified the code for the 
    port registers, the timers, the SPI and the ISR, so that it would work with 
    microcontrollers from the megaAVR® 0-series. In addition, I added a parameter 
    (GRAYSCALE_RESOLUTION) that allows one to adjust the PWM frequency, I renamed 
    some functions and parameters so that they resemble those from the Alex Leone 
    library, and I added a small configuration file (Tlc_AVR0_config.h). Most of 
    the modified code can be found in the Tlc_init() function in Tlc5940_AVR0.cpp. 

    The Arduino TLC5940_AVR0 Library is distributed WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. In no 
    event shall Scharre Soft™ be liable for any direct or indirect damages 
    arising out of the use of this software. Use at your own risk. The original 
    source code was made available by Matthew Pandina under a BSD-style license.
